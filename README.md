# Brain MRI Tumor Classifier

Welcome to the Brain MRI Tumor Classifier project! This repository contains code for a computer vision model that classifies whether a given brain MRI image has a tumor or not.

## Overview

The Brain MRI Tumor Classifier project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of assisting medical professionals in detecting brain tumors from MRI scans.

# Accuracy 

The highest accuracy i got was 82.5%

# Dataset

The dataset used for training was only 250 images in this project. This was the biggest challenge and we had to resort to data augmentation and pre-trained models. 

# Pre-trained models used 
- Xception
- ResNet
- VGG16
- MobileNet
  MobileNet gave us the best results

# To be added
- I want to try to further fine-tune my models in hopes of getting a higher accuracy even though an accuracy of 82.5% while only training 250 images is not bad.
